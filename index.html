        <p class="p-1">November 11, 1966 was a Friday and it was the 315th day of the year 1966. It was the 46th Friday of that year. The next time you can reuse your old 1966 calendar will be in 2022. Both calendars will be exactly the same! This is assuming you are not interested in the dates for Easter and other irregular holidays that are based on a lunisolar calendar.</p>
